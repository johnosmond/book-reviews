# Book Reviews

This is the second project in a Udemy tutorial which can be found here:
https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-beginner-fundamentals/learn/

## 2nd Run

This is the second time I've taken this tutorial and this project. This time I will do two things differently as a challenge.
First, I am using Laravel 11. The tutorial uses Laravel 10 so I will have to figure some differences out on my own.
Second, Laravel 11 uses SQLite by default now. You can force it to use MySQL, but again, as a challenge, I will try to complete the tutorial using SQLite as the database back-end.

### Conclusion

I've completed the tutorial. The last section, Rate Limiting, was very challenging because rate limiting and use of middleware have both changed since from Laravel 11 to Laravel 10. Additionally, the documentation about rate limiting is almost entirely about applying it to APIs, not web resources like 'Reviews'.

Turns out, it's actually easier to apply in L11 than in L10! I just had to figure out that you apply it to the route, not the controller. (In the video Poitr applies the middleware in the controller.)

I enjoyed this project very much. Looking forward to the next.
