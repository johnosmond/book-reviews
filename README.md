This is the second project in a Udemy tutorial which can be found here:

## 2nd Run

This is the second time I've taken this tutorial and this project. This time I will do two things differently as a challenge.
First, I am using Laravel 11. The tutorial uses Laravel 10 so I will have to figure some differences out on my own.
Second, Laravel 11 uses SQLite by default now. You can force it to use MySQL, but again, as a challenge, I will try to complete the tutorial using SQLite as the database back-end.
